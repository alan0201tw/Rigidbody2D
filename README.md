# Rigidbody2D

A simple 2D physics simulation with rigidbodies.

## Pipeline

```
step()
{
    List<Manifold> 'Ms'

    (optional block)
    for every rigidbody 'A'
    {
        Update its velocity by integration
    }
    (end)

    for every rigidbody 'A' from index [0, n)
    {
        for every "other" rigidbody 'B' from index [i+1, n)
        {
            Manifold 'M'
            if ( 'A' collides with 'B' )
            {
                'M' = info about the collision between 'A' and 'B'
                add 'M' to 'Ms'
            }
        }
    }

    for every Manifold 'M' in 'Ms'
    {
        Resolve collision 'M'
        // this is done by applying impulse, a change to velocity
    }

    for every rigidbody 'A'
    {
        Update its position and velocity by integration
    }

}

main loop()
{
    Accumulator 'Acc' = 0

    while(true)
    {
        Time 'curT' = currentTime()

        'Acc' += 'curT' - previousTime
        previousTime = 'curT'

        // clamp the accumulator to avoid overflowing, making system
        // go through too many steps in a single frame
        'Acc' = clamp( 'Acc', 0.0, 1.0 )

        while('Acc' > deltaTime)
        {
            step() // this refers to the function mentioned above
            'Acc' -= deltaTime
        }
    }
}

```

## Architecture

```
Scene
{
    List<Body> bodies;
}

Body (or Rigidbody2D)
{
    Shape s;
    Transform t;
    Material m;

    vec2 velocity;
    vec2 force;
    float mass;

    float staticFriction;
    float dynamicFriction;
    float restitution;
}

Manifold (or Collision2D)
{
    Body a, b; // the two objects that collide with each other
    float depth_of_penetration;
    vec2 normal;
    vec2 contacts[2]; // points of contact during collision
    uint contact_count; // number of contacts that occured during collision

    // some additional data for resolving collision
}

Shape (or Mesh2D)
{
    Body b; // referencing the body that uses this shape instance

    // some additional data for determining the 
    // actual shape of each shape instance
}

// implement classes that inherits 'Shape', 
// like a 'Circle', 'AABBRect', or 'Polygon'
```

## Design Detail

Every implementation of 'Shape' should also implement a visitor pattern interface where the collision detection and manifold generation is defined. For this, we need 'shapes' to have access to fields in 'Body' like mass and velocity.

While using the above pattern, we might come across a problem where we need to implement the same exact function twice ( visitor for 'Polygon' in class 'Circle', and vice versa ).

In this case we can just define some static functions with two shape implementations as parameter and let the visitor in both classes delegate the actual code to the static function.

## Additional

Maybe add some distance constraint, or spring joint, fixed joint?
